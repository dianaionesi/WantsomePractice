            <h3>TRENDING</h3>
            <h4>WHY BROWN MASCARA?</h4>
            <p>Brown mascara is a more subtle and natural-looking alternative to black mascara, meaning it’s a great way to achieve the ‘cool girl’ beauty look that’s trending right now. It can help to define your lashes without looking too intense, and is a great option for those with fair skin or hair. There are a few different ways to incorporate brown mascara into your makeup routine. For a subtle and natural look, apply brown mascara to your lashes without any other eye makeup. This is a great option for daytime or casual occasions, or to pull off AW23’s pared-back trend. Alternatively, team brown mascara with a brown or bronze eyeliner for a warm put-together look. This works beautifully with green or hazel eyes.</p>
